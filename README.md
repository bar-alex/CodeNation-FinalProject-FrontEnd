# Fitverse - our team's full-stack project for the Code Nation Bootcamp

It's an app created in ReactJS that will allow users to register on the website and record their fitness activities. It's meant more as a proof of concept and it has some limited functionality, for example, the accepted activities are "Running", "Cycling" and "Swimming", The available routes are pre-recorded and the users can't edit them or add any more.

This is the **front-end** of the app, for the back-end see this repository: [CodeNation-FinalProject-BackEnd](https://github.com/bar-alex/CodeNation-FinalProject-BackEnd).

A user can register themselves, log in if they have already been registered, can change their information or delete their account.
Once logged in, they will stay logged in between sessions for up to 7 days, or until they log out.
To change their information or delete their account, they must provide their password for authorisation.

On the routes page, they will observe a list of cards, each card representing a route for training, next to them is a google map that will show the location of all the available routes.
 
By selecting a route, a new page will open that will display some information about that route and a list of all the activities the user has registered for this route. The user will be able to record a new activity in the list for the training they have done.


## Getting Started with Create React App
<details>
  <summary>Click to show details.</summary>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
